# driver_install_py
My version of a driver install script. Can be set to run on start up as well for automated driver installations
Run script on admin priveleges, so it won't get stuck

Driver files should be added to the the Drivers folder that is packaged in the same directory as this script.

For single driver installation: you can launch and run it after moving driver into the correct folder

For multi-driver installation: recommended to set it to run on start-up scripts or task scheduler 
so it will automatically install all drivers without needing to continuously launch script 

Info and Errors can be found in driver_status.log when running
